## Live Coding Exercise [30m]

Let's use this (somewhat familiar) problem as a demo example:

> Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, 
goes through each and prints out the sum of them.

1. Pseudocode [10m]
2. Incremental Implementation [20m]

## Visualizing Code [10m]

## Recap & Takeaways [5m]

- Focus on errors (errors are your friend) ie error driven development
- Note: EDD is part of working incrementally. Working incrementally 
- Not everything needs to be in a function (some code outside a function)
- Writing pseudocode before writing code
- Learn through investigating (in your existing program/code or `node` (REPL))
  - Documentation is your friend, and so are mentors, but investigation up front is also great!
- KV finishes lectures late
- Getting comfortable with scopes in JS, but it will take some time to get fully comfortable with scoping
- Git 
  - Avoid git add . (bad habbit)
  - Use git status religiously (all the time)

## Closing Comments [5m]

- Lecture notes coming up
- Don't forget to give feedback once the notes are sent
